## Best hosting providers
### VPS
- [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/vps/) : Low prices, NVMe storage, but bad CPU frequencies (around 2.3GHz).
- [PrivateHeberg](https://privateheberg.com/VPS) : Good prices, NVMe or SSD storage, very **high cpu frequencies** (up to **5GHz**). VMs are probably running on dedicated servers hosted by OVH but it's still a good deal if we need good CPUs.
- [OMGServ](https://www.omgserv.com/fr/location/vps/game/) : Not the best reputation but this one could be an attractive offer. However PrivateHeberg's offer is more interesting in terms of price.

### Dedicated
- [Kimsufi](https://www.kimsufi.com/fr/serveurs.xml) : Dedicated server at a very good price but old hardware and bad support. Fork of OVH company.
- [SoYouStart](https://www.soyoustart.com/fr/serveurs-essential/) : A little more expensive but newer hardware (not the latest either) and better support. Fork of OVH company.
- [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/fr/serveurs_dedies/) : Very nice products but very more expensive.
- [IKoula](https://www.ikoula.com/fr/serveur-dedie) : The "classic" product range offers good CPUs at a very low price (beware of SATA II). The others dedicated servers look good too but I've never tested.
- [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/fr/dedibox/) : Some interesting offers but for very specific cases.
